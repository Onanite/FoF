                <p>For my woodworking project, I've decided to make a Telescope platform stand. This is based off of the Youtube video 
                    link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsGD9mU8cR0" target="_blank"> here </a></p>
                
                <p>I liked the overall design, but wanted the stand to come up higher, to around 5ft in height.</p>
                
                <p>To start this project, I drew up some plans on how to go about building this contraption...</p>

                <br>
                <p>After completing the draft, I went to purchase the materials needed to create the stool (exclusively from Home Depot)</p>

                <br>
                <p>Getting to Make Haven, I collected the parts and started tracing out the circle I planned to cut by finding the mid-point of the board then tracing out the radius of the top platform circle, 7.5".</p>
                <p>I then cut the edges of the board with the table saw, and cut out the circular shape with the bandsaw. I routered the edge of the circle after with the Roman Ogee bit.</p>

                <br>
                <p>I used the same technique for the leg bracers as was done with the top platform. I initially tried to use a trace provided in the video, but this wouldn't work
                    out b/c of the height differential. I was a bit concerned about the rain that got to the thin board and caused it to bow, but this turned out not to be an issue 
                    after cutting. I made 120 degree traces from the center point, then made traces based on smaller circles with an edge center point,  and finally used the smaller 
                    bandsaw to do all the cuts for the bracer panel.</p>

                <p>I traced 120 degree lines for door hinge install on the top plate, then intalled the hinges.</p>

                <br>
                <p>I cut 22.5 degree angles on the 2x4 leg ends, parallel to each other, then routed the edges and center to reduce weight. I accedently overcut one of the legs, and 
                    added extra length through a spare peice and using the biscuit cutter... only I glued on backwards!</p>

                <p>Areas of future improvement, upgrades:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Fix footing angle </li>
                    <li> Get shorter screws for top platform </li>
                    <li> Router additional grooves into leg sides </li>
                    <li> Sand down all routered edges </li>
                    <li> Put a stained or varnish finish onto the stand </li> 
                </ul>

                <p>Thanks for watching!</p>
