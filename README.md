# hello-world
Test repository

I've started this repository to build on an eventual one stop site for projects worked. 

A little about myself, I love getting out to hike/bike in wooded areas. I do a lot of cooking, and have been geared more towards a plant based diet lately. I enjoy reading books, mainly philosophical in subject but also business, science, and tech related. I'm an Astronomy enthusiast, although not a very technically knowledgable person. Traveling is something I plan on doing much more of, when the environment to travel becomes more possible to do so. I'm a fan of live music, and lean more towards the jazz, rock genres of music interest. I try to get out to live comedy shows where possible as well.
